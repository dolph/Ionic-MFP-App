# Develop Enterprise-grade Hybrid Mobile App with Cloud-native Backend

When developing your enterprise mobile app that needs centralized hosting of data, use of cloud-native services such as [Cloudant No-SQL Database](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant) for storing textual data and [Object Storage service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage) for storing image/video/audio data, allows you to quickly go from idea-conception to reality. The [Mobile Foundation service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/mobile-foundation) available from IBM Cloud provides a scalable mobile access gateway for securely accessing those backend services, and it provides other essential mobile backend capabilities such as push notifications, app lifecycle management and app analytics.

This code pattern gives you step by step instructions for developing an [Ionic/Cordova](https://ionicframework.com/) based hybrid mobile app that securely connects to Cloudant and Object Storage services via IBM MobileFoundation (aka MFP) service.

When you have completed this pattern, you will understand:
* How to authenticate users (through preemptive login) using MFP security adapter.
* How to write an MFP adapter that authenticates with Cloud Object Storage service and pass back the Authorization token to the mobile app.
* Recommended architectural patterns for coding the interaction between mobile app and Cloud Object Storage service.
* How to use [`imgcache.js`](https://github.com/chrisben/imgcache.js/) in Ionic app for caching images fetched from Cloud Object Storage service.
* How to show Google Maps in Ionic app as well as capture userâ€™s geo-location & image from camera.
* How to upload the captured image from mobile app to Cloud Object Storage service.
* How to fetch data from Cloudant service to mobile app via MFP adapter as well as post new data to Cloudant.
* How to customize the Ionic app logo and splash, and build the release apk for uploading to public/private app stores.

## Flow

<img src="doc/source/images/Architecture.png" alt="Architecture diagram" width="800" border="10" />

1. User launches the mobile app, enters his/her credentials on the login screen and clicks `Login`.
2. Mobile app sends the user credentials to MFP server for validation.
3. MFP server invokes the security adapter logic to validate user credentials and returns an appropriate response to the mobile app. For the sake of this demo, we will use a simple security adapter that returns success when password equals username.
4. If user authentication succeeds, mobile app proceeds to show the home page. As part of this, it makes a call to MFP adapter to fetch the data from Cloudant NoSQL database.
5. MFP adapter fetches the data from Cloudant and returns it to the mobile app. The data fetched from Cloudant will have references to the images stored in Cloud Object Storage.
6. Mobile app makes a call to MFP adapter to get the Authorization token for interacting with Cloud Object Storage service.
7. MFP adapter makes a call to Cloud Object Storage service's token manager endpoint to get the Authorization token
and returns it to the mobile app.
8. Mobile app initializes image-caching plugin and asks it to use an HTTP header of `Authorization=<value returned from MFP adapter>` while fetching images. Mobile app displays the data obtained from MFP adapter as a list of items. The image caching plugin running on the mobile app downloads and caches images from Cloud Object Storage.
9. User clicks on one of the list item to see more details. A detail page is shown consisting of image and geo-location marked inside Google Maps.
10. Back in the home page, user clicks on `+` button to report a new civic problem. A new page is shown where user can enter a description for the new civic problem as well as capture image and geo-location of the problem spot. User clicks on `Submit` button.
11. Mobile app uploads the textual data to Cloudant NoSQL DB via MFP Adapter.
12. Mobile app creates a thumbnail image by resizing the captured image and uploads both the captured image and thumbnail to Cloud Object Storage.
13. Other users who click on refresh button on the home page (and those who log in afresh) are shown the updated list of problem reports.

## Step 2. Create Cloudant database and populate it with sample data

### 2.1 Create Cloudant database

* Log in to [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/) and create [*Cloudant NoSQL DB*](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant) service.
* From the welcome page of Cloudant service that you just created, launch the Cloudant Dashboard.
* In the Cloudant Dashboard, click on `Databases`.
* Click on `Create Database`. Specify name of database as `myward` as shown below. Click `Create`.

<img src="doc/source/images/CreateCloudantDatabase.png" alt="Create Database in Cloudant NoSQL DB" width="800" border="10" />

Once the database is created, the dashboard will update to show the documents inside `myward` database (which, as expected, will be empty to begin with).

* Click `Create Document`. Under document content, after the auto populated `_id` field, enter grievance details as shown below. Please note that you need to put a comma (,) after the auto populated `_id` field.

<pre><code>
{
  "_id": "7fc63023799dfda9582609e75127b4fa"<b>,
  "reportedBy": "shivahr@gmail.com",
  "reportedDateTime": "20171125_152627",
  "picture": {
    "large": "IMG-20171125-WA0012.jpeg",
    "thumbnail": "thumbnail_IMG-20171125-WA0012.jpg"
  },
  "problemDescription": "Car parking on busy market road chocking movement of other vehicles and pedestrians",
  "geoLocation": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [
      77.7893168,
      13.0773568
    ]
  },
  "address": "Basaveshwara Temple road (behind Market Road), Hosakote, Bangalore 562114"</b>
}
</code></pre>

Click `Create Document` to create/save the document.

* Repeat the above steps and create documents for the remaining sample grievances: [SampleData/MyWardGrievance2.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance2.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance3.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance3.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance4.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance4.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance5.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance5.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance6.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance6.json).

The `myward` database should now list the six documents as shown below under `Table` view.

<img src="doc/source/images/CloudantDatabasePopulated.png" alt="Cloudant database populated with sample data" width="800" border="10" />

  &lt;property name="apiKey" displayName="Cloud Object Storage API Key" defaultValue="" /&gt;</b>
&lt;/mfp:adapter&gt;
</code></pre>

## Step 6. Deploy the MFP Adapters and Test them

### 6.1 Build and Deploy the MFP adapters

Build and deploy `UserLogin` adapter as below.

```
$ cd MobileFoundationAdapters/

$ cd UserLogin
$ mfpdev adapter build
$ mfpdev adapter deploy
```

  Note: In [Step 4](#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli), if you specified `No` to `Make this server the default?`, then you need to specify the name of your server profile (`Cloud-MFP` in our case) at the end of `mfpdev adapter deploy` command as shown below.
```
$ mfpdev adapter deploy Cloud-MFP
```

Build and deploy `MyWardData` adapter as below.

```
$ cd ../MyWardData/
$ mfpdev adapter build
$ mfpdev adapter deploy
```

### 6.2 Launch MFP dashboard and verify adapter configurations

Launch MFP Dashboard as below:
  * In the [IBM Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/dashboard/), under `Cloud Foundry Services`, click on the `Mobile Foundation` service you created in [Step 4](#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli). The service overview page that gets shown, will have the MFP dashboard embedded within it. You can also open the MFP dashboard in a separate browser tab by appending `/mfpconsole` to the *url* mentioned in [Step 4](#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli).
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, in the list on the left, you will see the `MyWardData` and `UserLogin` adapters listed.

Verify MFP Adapter configuration as below:
  * Inside the MFP dashboard, click on the `MyWardData` adapter. Under `Configurations` tab, you should see the various properties we specified in [Step 5.3](#53-specify-cloudant-credentials-in-mfp-adapter) and [Step 5.4](#54-specify-cloud-object-storage-credentials-in-mfp-adapter) for accessing Cloudant database and Cloud Object Storage as shown below. As an alternative to specifying those property values in `MobileFoundationAdapters/MyWardData/src/main/adapter-resources/adapter.xml` as previously shown in [Step 5.3](#53-specify-cloudant-credentials-in-mfp-adapter) and [Step 5.4](#54-specify-cloud-object-storage-credentials-in-mfp-adapter), you can deploy the adapters with empty `defaultValue`, and once the adapter is deployed, change the values on this page.

  - Launch the Settings app on your phone. Select `About Device` -> `Software Info`. Tap `Build number` 7 times to enable developer options.
  - Return to Settings list. Select `Developer options` and enable `USB debugging`.
* If you are developing on Windows, then you need to install the appropriate USB driver as per instructions in https://developer.android.com/studio/run/oem-usb.
* Connect the Android phone to your development machine by USB cable, and accept `allow` access on your phone.

### 7.3 Setup API keys for using Google Maps

* Get an API key for using the Google Maps Android API as per instructions in https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup.

  You can similarly get an API key for using the Google Maps SDK for iOS as per instructions in
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/get-api-key.

* Add the Google Maps API keys into the `MyWard` app as below:

```
$ cd ../../IonicMobileApp/
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-googlemaps --variable API_KEY_FOR_ANDROID="<Your_API_key_for_using_GoogleMaps_Android_API>" --variable API_KEY_FOR_IOS="<Your_API_key_for_using_GoogleMaps_SDK_for_iOS>" PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION=15.0.1
```

Note: Make sure you specify the latest PLAY_SERVICES_VERSION in the command above.

### 7.4 Enable Android platform for Ionic application

* Add [Cordova platform for Android](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/)
```
$ cd ../IonicMobileApp
$ ionic cordova platform add android@6.3.0
> cordova platform add android@6.3.0 --save
...
```

  Note: Make sure the Cordova platform version being added is supported by the MobileFirst plug-ins. Site https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/sdk/cordova/ lists the supported levels.
```
$ cordova platform version
Installed platforms:
  android 6.3.0
Available platforms:
  blackberry10 ~3.8.0 (deprecated)
  browser ~4.1.0
  ios ~4.4.0
  osx ~4.0.1
  webos ~3.7.0
```

### 7.5 Register the MyWard app to MFP server

```
$ cd ../IonicMobileApp
$ mfpdev app register
Verifying server configuration...
Registering to server:'https://mobilefoundation-71-hb-server.mybluemix.net:443' runtime:'mfp'
Updated config.xml file located at: .../Ionic-MFP-App/IonicMobileApp/config.xml
Run 'cordova prepare' to propagate changes.
Registered app for platform: android
```

  Note: In [Step 4](#step-4-create-mobile-foundation-service-and-configure-mfp-cli), if you specified `No` to `Make this server the default?`, then you need to specify the name of your server profile (`Cloud-MFP` in our case) at the end of `mfpdev app register` command as shown below.
```
$ mfpdev app register Cloud-MFP
```

  Propagate changes by running `cordova prepare`
```
$ ionic cordova prepare
```

### 7.6 Build/Run the Ionic application on Android phone

* Build Android application
```
$ cd ../IonicMobileApp
$ ionic cordova build android
```

 Â Note: In case the Cordova build fails due to missing `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables, then set those environment variables as per instructions in https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/#setting-environment-variables. `ANDROID_HOME` should be set to the `Android SDK Location` that you noted in [Step 7.1](#71-install-android-studio-and-android-sdk-platform). Command `/usr/libexec/java_home` returns the value to be used for setting `JAVA_HOME` on [macOS](https://mattshomepage.com/articles/2016/May/22/java_home_mac_os_x/). On other platforms you could run `java -XshowSettings:properties 2>&1 | grep 'java.home'` as mentioned [here](http://sbndev.astro.umd.edu/wiki/Finding_and_Setting_JAVA_HOME#Sample_Perl_Script:_java_home).

* Run application on Android device
```
$ ionic cordova run android
```

  <img src="doc/source/images/MyWardAppHomePage.png" alt="MyWard App - Home Page" width="240" border="10" /> <img src="doc/source/images/MyWardAppDetailPage.png" alt="MyWard App - Problem Detail Page" width="240" border="10" /> <img src="doc/source/images/MyWardAppReportNewPage.png" alt="MyWard App - Report New Problem Page" width="240" border="10" />


### 7.7 Update App Logo and Splash

Reference: Automating Icons and Splash Screens https://blog.ionicframework.com/automating-icons-and-splash-screens/

Copy your desired app icon to `IonicMobileApp/resources/icon.png` and app splash to `IonicMobileApp/resources/splash.png`.

```
$ cd ../IonicMobileApp
$ ionic cordova resources
```

For running `ionic cordova resources` command, you would need to sign up on [ionicframework.com](https://ionicframework.com/) and specify the credentials on the command line.

### 7.8 Build APK for uploading to Google Play Store

Reference: https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/deploying/

* Add following lines at the end of `IonicMobileApp/platforms/android/proguard-project-mfp.txt`:
```
-dontwarn okhttp3.internal.huc.**
-keep class plugin.google.maps.** { *; }
```

* Create release build as below:
```
$ cd ../IonicMobileApp
$ ionic cordova build android --prod --release
```

* Set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable as per instructions in [Step 7.6](#76-buildrun-the-ionic-application-on-android-phone). On Mac, this is usually:
```
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk
```

* Zip align release build as below:
```
$ cd ./platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/
$ ls
android-release-unsigned.apk
$ $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/23.0.3/zipalign -v -p 4 android-release-unsigned.apk android-release-unsigned-aligned.apk
$ ls
android-release-unsigned-aligned.apk	android-release-unsigned.apk
```

* Create self signing certificate as below:

Make a note of the `Keystore password` that you set. You would need it for signing your APK.

```
$ keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-alias

Enter keystore password:
Re-enter new password:

	for: CN=Shiva Kumar H R, OU=ISL, O=IBM, L=Bangalore, ST=Karnataka, C=IN
Enter key password for <my-alias>
	(RETURN if same as keystore password):
[Storing my-release-key.jks]

$ ls
android-release-unsigned-aligned.apk	android-release-unsigned.apk		my-release-key.jks
```

* Self sign APK as below:
```
$ $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/23.0.3/apksigner sign --ks my-release-key.jks --out myward.apk android-release-unsigned-aligned.apk
Keystore password for signer #1:
$ ls
android-release-unsigned-aligned.apk	my-release-key.jks
android-release-unsigned.apk		myward.apk
$
```

* Distribute `myward.apk` by uploading to Google Play Store or to your company's internal App store.
